Add camera, object, light after '#'.

Camera have position. Rotation can be missed(default angle_x: 0, angle_y: 0). 

Put '#' in single line, after type in new line name of object(primitive or light or camera) with ":".
Than in new line after one tabulation put name of parameter, ":" and data divided by 'space'.

!!If you miss some object/parameter or make mistake in syntax, program will fill it by default values!!
!!Undefined behaviour: put light spot on object surface!!
!!Undefined behaviour: put view of camera on object surface!!
!!Undefined behaviour: !!

Objects and parameters:
1. CAMERA: position, angle_x, angle_y
2. Lights:
  -AMBIENT: intensivity;                     --- ambient light
  -POINT: intensivity, position;             --- spot light
  -DIRECT: intensivity, rotation;            --- directional light
  -PARALLEL: intensivity, rotation, angle    --- parallel light
3. Primitive:
  -PLANE: center, rotation, color, reflective, specular, slice;
  -SPHERE: center, radius, color, reflective, specular, slice;
  -CYLINDER: center, rotation, radius, color, reflective, specular, slice;
  -CONE: center, rotation, angle, color, reflective, specular, slice;
  -BOCAL: center, rotation, color, reflective, specular, slice.

To add slice type: slice: own origin: 0 0 0 axis: 0 1 0
Only one slice is accepted

Exemple:
#
POINT:
	position: -4 8 -3
	intensivity: 0.7
#
PLANE:
	color: 121 110 122
	rotation: 0 0 7
#
CAMERA:
	position: -4 7 -15
	angle_y: 20
	angle_x: -10
